I am a founder working on a project that is not yet ready to be announced. The
goal for my blog will be to journal the process of starting a company, which
hopefully will be successful.

On the way, I'm sure I will also throw in my two cents on technology, personal
development, and things that I generally find interesting.

Writing and self-reflection is good for the soul, so I intend to make writing
a habit and hopefully this means new entries several times a week.

Hope you stick around!

> Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,  
 And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so **ad infinitum**.  
 And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on,  
 While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.
